        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite reverse-sear steak recipe! Due to the nature of reverse-searing, this can be done with a frozen steak in a pinch. Just lower the temperature of the oven step and bake for longer!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your favorite cut of steak -- I like tri-tip</li>
            <li>High smoke-point oil, like avocado or grapeseed</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Any other seasonings of your liking!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat your steak dry with a paper towel</li>
            <li>Season the surface liberally with salt</li>
            <li>Bake in oven at 350F-ish for 12-ish minutes</li>
            <li>Heat up a cast-iron or other non-stick pan and add a tablespoon or two of oil</li>
            <li>Place your steak in the pan</li>
            <li>After steak is almost seared to your liking, add butter to pan along with any other seasonings if desired</li>
            <li>After steak is cooked to your liking, take out and let rest for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Slice, plate, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
